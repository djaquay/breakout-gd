* scorekeeping
* speed increase
* start/end of game logic, display
* three lives
* high score
* improved visuals (add colors, bevels)
* additional styles/behaviors of bricks (e.g. extra balls)
	* motion (gradual up/down; alternating left/right)
* better player control
	* angle control based on location of impact
	* ball capture/release (perhaps as temporary brick-rewarded buff)

## Done

* basic scene structure
* basic visual scene elements (walls, HUD, player, ball, bricks)
* mechanical scene elements (collision rects, etc.)
* brick setup, addition
