brick setup, addition
brick collision
brick removal
scorekeeping
speed increase

high score
improved visuals (start with white rects for everything, but add colors, bevels)
additional styles/behaviors of bricks (e.g. extra balls)
better player control
	angle control based on location of impact
	ball capture/release (perhaps as temporary brick-rewarded buff)
